    <h2> DANIELE MONIQUE SALES PIERINI </h2>
    <h2> Dani </h2> 
    <p> I am married, I have a wonderful husband who always supports me and we have 3 wonderful daughters aged 1-9 years. We live in Florian√≥polis-Brazil. Here is a wonderful Island </p>
    <p> In my spare time I like to go to the beach, to read, to watch movies and series, to travel, explore and relax and to decorate in DIY style. I love to study, learn new things and spend time with my family. </p>
    <p> What I love most about BYU is that we are constantly reminded of how much our Heavenly Father loves us and wants to help us reach our fullest potential. </p>
    <p> One of my favorite scriptures is Doctrine and Covenants 88:78-80 and 130:18-19. </p>
    <p> One of the quotes that encourages me to always want to learn more is "Put yourself in your studies. (...) Study as much as you can." President Gordon B. Hinckley. </p>
